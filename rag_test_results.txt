Question 2: How does the performance appraisal process work?
----------------------------------------
Answer: The performance appraisal process at Exquitech involves several key steps:

1. **Annual Appraisal**: Conducted once a year, typically in Q4, this comprehensive evaluation covers the entire year's performance and reflects the official overall employee performance for that year.

2. **Mid-Year Review**: Conducted midway through the appraisal cycle, typically in Q2, this review focuses on progress toward goals, ongoing feedback, and adjustments. It monitors the progress of employee objectives and prepares for the end-of-year performance review.

3. **Setting Objectives**: All Exquitech team members are required to set their organizational and personal objectives and discuss them with their managers by mid-December for the upcoming year. These objectives must be set in a SMART way (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timebound) and are then approved by management.

4. **Self-Assessment**: Employees complete a self-assessment form reflecting on their achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement over the appraisal period.

5. **Manager Assessment**: Managers evaluate employee performance based on predefined criteria, including job responsibilities, goals, competencies, and overall contribution. They also collect feedback from peers and subordinates.

6. **Formal Meeting**: A formal meeting is held between the employee and their manager to discuss the self-assessment, manager assessment, and any 360-degree feedback. This discussion includes achievements, areas for improvement, career aspirations, and goal setting for the next appraisal period.

7. **Goal Setting and Development Plan**: A development plan is created to support the employee's growth and address any areas for improvement.

8. **Documentation and Sign-Off**: All assessments, feedback, and agreed-upon goals and development plans are documented in the performance appraisal system. Both the employee and manager electronically submit the appraisal forms in the system.

9. **Rewards and Recognitions**: Performance ratings may lead to eligibility for performance bonuses and salary adjustments, subject to management approval. However, employees are not eligible for promotions, bonuses, or adjustments after the mid-year review unless a valid exception is provided and approved.

Overall, the process is designed to assist team members in their jobs, ensure they have the right knowledge and skills, and support their personal development.

Question 4: What is the probation period policy?
----------------------------------------
Answer: The probation period policy requires a probationary period of three to six months for new team members, based on the country Labor Law. This period is used to review the employee's performance and suitability for the job. During this time, the manager evaluates the employee's performance against established standards and objectives, provides feedback, and conducts performance evaluations. At the end of the probation period, the manager should have confidence that the employee meets or exceeds performance standards, with an overall rating of greater than 80%. If the employee's performance is unsatisfactory, the company has the right to terminate the employment contract or extend the probation period.

Question 5: How does the 360 feedback system work?
----------------------------------------

5. **Feedback Review**: The employee and their manager review the aggregated feedback in a one-on-one meeting, during which a personal development plan (PDP) is created based on the findings.

6. **Action Plan**: Employees set measurable goals for improvement based on the feedback received.

7. **Monitoring and Adjustment**: HR monitors the process for fairness and effectiveness, and follow-ups are scheduled to assess progress.

   - Timely clients can proceed without delay.
   - Intermediate clients can proceed with a clear payment plan.
   - Moderate Concern clients require additional finance approval and a revised payment plan.
   - Concerned clients will have new projects postponed until balances are cleared or a payment plan is adhered to.
   - High-Risk clients cannot authorize new projects or licenses until all outstanding balances are settled.

6. **Add-ons to Licenses**: Before placing an order for add-ons, any outstanding invoices must be addressed. No additional orders will be processed until open invoices are cleared or a mutually agreed payment plan is established.

7. **Risk Mitigation and Communication**: Regular account reviews for moderate to high-risk clients are conducted, and there is ongoing communication between accounting and operations regarding payment status. Clients are regularly contacted about payment terms and upcoming invoices.

8. **Flexibility for Strategic Clients**: Flexible payment terms may be offered to strategic clients, but these must be documented and approved by senior management.
